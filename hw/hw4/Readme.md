# PA4

## Part 1

- For this part of the assignment I have implemented a bst. In order to use a bst datastructure in a program simple put `#include "bst.h"` in the header file and you will be able to use the datastructure

## Part 2

- For this part of the assignment I have implemented an AVLTree, which inherits from and expands the functionality of bst, making the datastructure a lot faster. In order to use a bst datastructure in a program simple put `#include "avlbst.h"` in the header file and you will be able to use the datastructure

## Part 3

- For this part I created a program that, given an input file that gives the dimensions of a grid, and dimensions of tiles, returns info on how to place the tiles on the grid so that none overlap. Tiles are able to be rotated 90 degrees. To compile, enter `make` into the command line and to run, enter `./floorplan <input filename> <output filename>`
